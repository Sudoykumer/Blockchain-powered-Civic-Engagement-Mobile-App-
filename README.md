# Blockchain-Powered Civic Engagement App (Prototype)

## Overview:

This project is a prototype of a Blockchain-powered Civic Engagement App designed to combat corruption and malpractice by government employees and project contractors in sectors such as roads, hospitals, construction, railways, metro, bridges, and urban development.

The app enables citizens to report illegal activities by capturing and uploading evidence (photos, videos, audio, documents). Evidence is then shown on a public transparency feed and linked to a simulated blockchain transaction ID, ensuring that reports cannot be deleted or tampered with.

This prototype is a UI-only clickable mockup — it demonstrates navigation and user flow, but does not include real blockchain or backend functionality.

## Target Beneficiaries:

Citizens using government and public services, local communities in roads, hospitals, railways, metro, bridges, and urban projects, government authorities for monitoring and accountability, law enforcement agencies and vigilance bodies, lawmakers and policymakers, anti-corruption agencies and audit institutions, media and civil society watchdogs.

## Expected Impact:

Increased citizen participation in governance

Greater transparency in public projects

Reduced corruption and malpractice

Timely reporting to police, lawmakers, and anti-corruption agencies

Stronger accountability in government projects and services

Empowered communities with secure reporting tools

Restored trust in institutions

## Technology / Platform Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript → Frontend UI prototype

LocalStorage → Temporary data persistence (prototype only)

Web Crypto API (simulated) → Fake blockchain transaction IDs

Blockchain (planned) → Immutable evidence storage in production

Mobile App (planned) → Android/iOS for large-scale citizen adoption

Cloud Services (planned) → Real-time notifications & data backup

## Features in Prototype:

Login / Anonymous Mode

Public Transparency Feed (sample reports)

Create Report Form (dummy submission flow)

Notifications Panel (simulated alerts)

Stakeholder Dashboard (static table)

Responsive UI for mobile & desktop

## Disclaimer:

This is a prototype only.

Blockchain is simulated (reports show fake SHA-256 TX IDs).

File uploads and evidence storage are placeholders.

No real police or government integration.

In production, reports would be stored on a real blockchain and securely shared with stakeholders.

## How to Run:

Save the file as prototype.html.

Open it in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

Click through the navigation:

Home → See preloaded sample posts

Report → Fill dummy form, see new entry in feed

Notifications → View simulated alerts

Dashboard → Check stakeholder view
